# Roxy

> An open-source AI coding agent for engineers — built as a cross-platform desktop app.

**Download:** [https://roxy.gg](https://roxy.gg)

Roxy is an [Electron](https://www.electronjs.org/) application written in **TypeScript** with a
**React** renderer. It ships a full agent **harness** in the main process: a provider-agnostic
tool-calling loop, per-model tuned system prompts, Plan/Build agents and subagents, disk-backed
context management, and integrations for MCP servers, language-server diagnostics, and `SKILL.md`
skills.

## Architecture notes

- **Context isolation is enabled** and `nodeIntegration` is off. The renderer talks to the main
  process only through the typed `window.api` bridge defined in [`src/preload`](src/preload/index.ts).
- IPC handlers live in [`src/main/ipc`](src/main/ipc/index.ts). Add a new renderer-facing capability
  by registering an `ipcMain.handle(...)` there and exposing a matching method in the preload bridge.

### Agent harness

The main process runs a single provider-agnostic agent loop; the renderer only streams events.

- **Tool loop** — [`src/main/harness/agent.ts`](src/main/harness/agent.ts) owns the turn loop, the
  tool JSON-schemas (`BASE_SCHEMAS`), context trimming, and subagent dispatch.
  [`tools.ts`](src/main/harness/tools.ts) is the authoritative `runTool` dispatcher. The user-facing
  catalog in [`src/shared/tools.ts`](src/shared/tools.ts) mirrors it (the "Skills & Tools" page) and
  is guarded against drift by the shared smoke suite.
- **Providers** — the hand-rolled OpenAI/Copilot SSE path (with Copilot's short-lived-token refresh)
  lives in [`services/llm.ts`](src/main/services/llm.ts); Anthropic + Google route through the Vercel
  AI SDK in [`services/aisdk.ts`](src/main/services/aisdk.ts) so every family gets tool-calling.
- **Prompts & agents** — tuned per-model prompts are selected in
  [`src/shared/prompt.ts`](src/shared/prompt.ts) and inlined from `resources/prompts/*.txt` via `?raw`
  in [`prompt-text.ts`](src/shared/prompt-text.ts). Plan/Build agents + subagents are defined in
  [`src/shared/agents.ts`](src/shared/agents.ts); an agent's `tools` allowlist and `promptFile` are
  what make Plan genuinely read-only.
- **Context management** — overflow is measured against the model's real limit
  ([`src/shared/context.ts`](src/shared/context.ts)); large tool outputs spill to disk with a preview
  pointer ([`services/tool-output-store.ts`](src/main/services/tool-output-store.ts)); older turns are
  summarized by [`services/compaction.ts`](src/main/services/compaction.ts).
- **Ecosystem** — external tool servers via the MCP client
  ([`services/mcp.ts`](src/main/services/mcp.ts)), language-server diagnostics fed back after edits
  ([`services/lsp.ts`](src/main/services/lsp.ts)), and on-demand `SKILL.md` skills
  ([`services/skills.ts`](src/main/services/skills.ts)). Roxy's own differentiators — the persistent
  browser toolset ([`services/browser.ts`](src/main/services/browser.ts)) and recurring "loops"
  ([`services/loops.ts`](src/main/services/loops.ts)) — run through the same loop.

### Remote Workspace

Take a running session to your phone. **Remote Workspace** (bottom-left **CUSTOMIZE** group in the
sidebar) mints a room on roxy.gg, shows a QR + safe URL + PIN, and keeps the desktop as the
authoritative host while a phone drives it as a thin client — **your code and files never leave the
machine**; only the chat transcript and streamed agent events are relayed.

- **Host service** — [`main/services/remote.ts`](src/main/services/remote.ts) mints via
  `POST https://roxy.gg/api/remote/sessions`, holds the **host token**, and keeps a host WebSocket
  alive (auto-reconnect w/ backoff). On a guest `hello` it sends a transcript snapshot; on a guest
  `prompt` it persists the message and runs the turn, fanning every `LlmEvent` to the phone **and**
  the local renderer. **Stop sharing** revokes the room (host-token `DELETE`).
- **One loop, no drift** — both the local `llm:start` IPC path and a remote prompt call the shared
  [`main/services/session-turn.ts`](src/main/services/session-turn.ts) `runSessionTurn`, so a phone
  prompt behaves identically to a local one.
- **IPC** — `remote:start | remote:stop | remote:status` + a `remote:state` push
  ([`src/shared/ipc.ts`](src/shared/ipc.ts)), handlers in
  [`src/main/ipc`](src/main/ipc/index.ts), bridge in [`src/preload`](src/preload/index.ts), types in
  [`src/shared/api.ts`](src/shared/api.ts). The QR popup is
  [`renderer/src/components/RemoteWorkspaceDialog.tsx`](src/renderer/src/components/RemoteWorkspaceDialog.tsx)
  (offline QR via `qrcode.react` — nothing leaves the machine).
- **Security** — no login: a short-lived HMAC guest token rides in the URL fragment and the phone
  must also enter the **PIN** shown on the desktop. The room (and its tokens) is revoked on Stop, on
  too many wrong PINs, at the TTL, or shortly after the desktop disconnects. See the relay + protocol
  details in the [roxy.gg README](../roxy.gg/README.md#remote-workspace).
