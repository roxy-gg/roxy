 * boxes pinned to one edge of their trigger (`left-0` / `right-0`) with no idea
 * where the window ends. That is fine until a trigger sits near an edge — then
 * the box simply runs off screen and is cut, because the app root is
 * `overflow: hidden` and there is nothing to scroll.
 *
 * The Processes popover hit this first (widest box, and its trigger is the LAST
 * segment of a centered row, so it starts furthest right), but the bug is
 * structural: every one of these menus has it. These two functions are the whole
 * fix — clamp the box into the viewport, and cap its height to the room actually
 * available on the side it opens toward.
 *
 * Kept here, pure and DOM-free, for the same reason `place` is: the interesting
 * part is the arithmetic at the edges, and that deserves tests. See
 * lib/useMenuAnchor.ts for the wiring.
