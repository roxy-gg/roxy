/**
 * Installs the squircle paint worklet and flips the `data-squircle` flag on
 * <html> once it's live. Everything in `main.css` under `[data-squircle]` stays
 * inert until then, so the app renders correct (just circular) corners on the
 * first frame and upgrades in place -- no flash of unstyled boxes, and no broken
 * UI if the API is missing.
 *
 * The worklet source is inlined with `?raw` and loaded from a blob: URL rather
 * than shipped as a separate chunk, because `addModule()` needs a URL that
 * resolves identically under the dev server (http://localhost) and in the packaged
 * app (file://), and Vite would otherwise treat the worklet as a normal module
 * and rewrite/hash it into `assets/`.

/**
 * Custom properties the worklet reads. Registering them buys three things a plain
 * `--var` doesn't have: the paint callback re-runs when the value changes, the
 * worklet receives a parsed `CSSUnitValue`/color instead of a raw token string,
 * and each has an initial value so an element that only sets `--sq-r` still gets a
 * sane ring color.
 *
 * Registration order is not significant, but the SET is: `paint()` only re-runs
 * when a property listed in the painter's `inputProperties` changes, so anything
 * added there has to be registered here or it will be read once and then go
 * stale on hover.
