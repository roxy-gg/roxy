/**
 * Subagent parallelism primitives — the pure, dependency-free half of Phase 11.
 *
 * Roxy's agent loop owns its own tool dispatch (unlike opencode, which hands
 * concurrency to the Vercel AI SDK), so we run a turn's `task` calls ourselves —
 * concurrently, but through a *bounded* pool so a model that emits a dozen
 * subagents at once can't thrash the machine. opencode runs tools with
 * `concurrency: "unbounded"` and hides background subagents behind an
 * experimental flag; we do bounded parallelism and make background tasks a
 * first-class, always-on capability.
 *
 * Everything here is pure (no Node/Electron/Buffer) so it runs in the harness,
 * the renderer, and the smoke:shared pure-Node harness alike.
