/**
 * Live transcripts for running subagent (`sub`) sessions.
 *
 * A subagent's steps used to exist in exactly two places: forwarded into the
 * PARENT turn's stream as `tool-child` events (which is why the launching
 * session shows the delegate working live), and persisted to the sub session's
 * own row — once, at the very end. Opening the sub session mid-run therefore
 * showed nothing but the seeded prompt: no streamed event ever carried the sub
 * session's id, so the renderer had nothing to key a live bubble on.
 *
 * This registry is the missing half. Each run registers here, folds its own
 * events into its own `PartsFold`, and broadcasts them tagged with the SUB
 * session id. Two consumers, one source:
 *
 *   - `subagent:delta` — the live feed, for a window already on that session.
 *   - `subagent:snapshot` — the catch-up read, for a window that opens the
 *     session halfway through a run. Without it a late viewer would see only
 *     the tail of the transcript.
 *
 * The parent's `tool-child` forwarding is untouched and still authoritative for
 * the `task` card; this is a second tap on the same event stream, not a
 * replacement. Keeping them separate is deliberate: the parent card is a capped
 * *summary* (see CHILD_OUTPUT_CAP), while the sub session is the full-fidelity
 * view, and neither should be able to distort the other.
 *
 * Broadcast, not point-to-point, for the same reason background tasks are: a run
 * routinely outlives the request that launched it, so there is no requestId to
 * route by — and after a window reload, no request at all.
