/**
 * Anonymous usage tracking.
 *
 * WHAT IT SENDS: a random UUID minted once at install, an event name, and the
 * coarse build facts (platform, arch, app version, stable/dev). No account, no
 * IP, no file paths, no prompt text, no model, no repo names. The server HMACs
 * the id before storing it, so a row cannot be mapped back to the id this client
 * holds.
 *
 * THE ONE EXCEPTION is `prompt`, which carries which PROVIDER served the turn.
 * `sanitize` below maps it through the shipped seed list on the way into the
 * queue, so it can only ever be one of the ~50 ids already public in this repo -
 * a custom endpoint is recorded as `other`. The MODEL is still never sent: it is
 * far higher-cardinality and isn't what the public chart shows.
 *
 * WHY IT'S SHAPED LIKE THIS:
 *  - **Never blocks the app.** Every call is fire-and-forget and every failure
 *    is swallowed. Analytics must not be able to break, slow, or crash a launch.
 *  - **Queued and batched.** Events accumulate and flush on a timer, so a user
 *    on a plane doesn't lose their session and we don't make one HTTP request
 *    per action.
 *  - **Idempotent.** Each event carries a `clientId`; the server dedupes on it,
 *    so re-sending a failed batch can't inflate the numbers.
 *  - **Opt-out is real.** `setTrackingEnabled(false)` stops collection *and*
 *    drops anything already queued.
 *
 * The install id and the opt-out live in their own JSON file, NOT in the
 * settings table: a factory reset (`repo.resetAll`) wipes settings, and someone
 * who opted out must stay opted out across one. It also means tracking has no
 * dependency on the database being open or mid-migration.
