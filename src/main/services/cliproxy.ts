/**
 * CLIProxyAPI sidecar — lets a user spend their own AI subscriptions (ChatGPT /
 * Codex, and Google's Gemini plan) inside Roxy.
 *
 * The shape of the thing: release builds embed a checksum-verified CLIProxyAPI
 * executable before Roxy is signed. Roxy writes a config that binds it to
 * 127.0.0.1 on a free port, spawns it, and drives its Management API to run an
 * OAuth login. From then on the
 * sidecar is just an OpenAI-compatible endpoint at http://127.0.0.1:<port>/v1 —
 * a wire Roxy already speaks — and the provider row for it looks like any other
 * `openai-chat` provider.
 *
 * ONE process backs EVERY subscription. Running a second copy to serve a second
 * login would double the download, the memory, and the number of things that can
 * crash, for no gain: the sidecar is explicitly multi-account and multi-upstream.
 * What that buys in simplicity it charges in care — the install, the port, and
 * the health check are GLOBAL, while accounts, logins, and model lists are
 * strictly PER-UPSTREAM. Every exported function below is on one side of that
 * line, and conflating them is how one provider ends up claiming the other's
 * accounts or serving models it cannot reach.
 *
 * Three invariants shape everything below.
 *
 * 1. The user's OAuth tokens live in the sidecar's `auth-dir`, never in Roxy's
 *    `credentials` table. Roxy holds only the *local* API key it generated to
 *    talk to its own sidecar. If Roxy is uninstalled the tokens go with the
 *    auth-dir; nothing to leak from the database.
 *
 * 2. Nothing binds to a non-loopback address, and both the proxy port and the
 *    management key are generated per install. A CLIProxyAPI on 0.0.0.0 with a
 *    known key is an open relay to the user's paid subscription.
 *
 * 3. Packaged builds execute only the sidecar embedded before app signing, and
 *    verify its binary hash again before launch. Development keeps the pinned,
 *    checksum-verified download path as a fallback for the live smoke test.
 *
 * Lifecycle is lazily driven: nothing is spawned until someone actually clicks
 * Sign in, and `ensureRunning` is idempotent so every later
 * caller (a turn, a model list) just gets the already-running instance.
