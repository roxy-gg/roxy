/**
 * Forge status: the single entry point the rest of the app uses to ask
 * "what is the state of this branch, locally AND on the server?".
 *
 * The design constraint that shapes everything here: the workstream strip polls
 * every 5 seconds, and a naive implementation would issue an API request per
 * poll per session — a rate-limit ban within minutes, plus a UI that stutters
 * whenever the network is slow.
 *
 * So this module is built around one rule: GIT IS SYNCHRONOUS, THE FORGE IS
 * NOT. A status call returns local git state immediately and serves forge data
 * from cache, refreshing it in the background at a much slower cadence. The
 * chip therefore never blocks, never flickers, and never depends on the network
 * to show what it already knows.
